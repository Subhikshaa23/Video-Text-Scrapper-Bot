BLUETOOTH
* Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used for exchanging data
between fixed and mobile devices over short distances using
short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM radio bands, from 2.400
to 2.485 GHz, and building personal area networks (PANs).
* It was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data
cables.
* Bluetooth is a wireless technology named after Harold Bluetooth,
based on an analogy that Bluetooth technblogy would unite devices
the way Harald Bluetooth united the tribes of Denmark into a single
kingdom.

BLUETOOTH
Bluetooth is specified by an industry consortium called the Bluetooth
Special Interest Group.
It specifies an entire suite of protocols. going beyond the link layer to
define application protocols, which iT calls profiles. for a range of
applications
o There is a profile for synchronizing a PDA with personal computer.
o Another profile gives o mobile computer access toa wired LAN.
The basic Bluetooth network configuration is called a piconet.
o Consists of a master device and up to seven slave devices.
o Any communication is between the master and a slave.
o The slaves do not communicate directly with each other,
o A slave con be parked: set to an inactive. low-power state

PROS
-k Low cost.
Easy to use.
It can also penetrate through walls.
It creates an ad-hoc connection immediately without any
wires.
It is used for voice and data transfer.

CONS
* It can be hacked and hence, less secure.
•k It has slow data transfer rate.
* It has small range: IO meters

BLUESNARFING
* 81uesnarfing is the unauthorized access of information from a wireless
device through a Bluetooth connection. often between phones.
desktops. laptops. and PDAs.
* This allows access to calendars, contact lists. emails and text
messages, ond on some phones. users con copy pictures and private
videos.
* Bluesnarfing is the theft of information from the target device.
